# Simulate Probability Experiments

## Author: Katrina Hill

## Description
This Java program simulates various probability-based events such as coin tosses, rolling a die, drawing cards from a deck, and compound events using randomization. It provides an easy way to explore the frequency and probability of different outcomes in these probability exercises.

## Features
- Coin Toss Simulation: Simulates 100 coin tosses, counting occurrences of heads and tails.
- Die Roll Simulation: Rolls a six-sided die 60 times, counting the occurrences of each side.
- Card Drawing Simulation: Simulates drawing 20 cards from a shuffled deck, counting the red and black cards drawn.
- Compound Event Simulation: Simulates 50 pairs of coin flips to determine frequencies of outcomes like two heads (HH), two tails (TT), and one of each (HT).

## Files
- `Probability.java`: The main program that performs the simulations.

## Requirements
- JDK version 8 or higher

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository** (or download the files):
    - git clone https://github.com/katrina-l-hill/simulate_probability.git
    - cd into the repository directory
2. **Run the Main program**:
    - Open an IDE and select Open Project
    - Navigate to the cloned repository folder and open it
      - The IDE will recognize `Probability.java`. Compile and run it directly from within the IDE.
3. **Run the tests**:
    - run tests in IDE (this will depend on the IDE being used)
